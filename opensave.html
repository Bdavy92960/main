<H2>Opening sequences</H2>
<p>To open an existing sequence, choose <i>Open sequence</i> in the <i>File</i> menu. You will be asked to choose a file. Sequence files always end in .seq and can be created either with OLAN or OpenAero.</p>
<H2>Saving sequences</H2>
<p>To save the current sequence as a .seq file, choose <i>Save sequence</i> in the <i>File</i> menu. Your computer will then download the data and, depending on the browser, ask for a file name to save the sequence as. Always ensure to give the sequence a file name ending in .seq!
 These files can only be opened by OpenAero and not by OLAN.</p>
<h2>Saving the current form (A, B or C) as an image</h2>
<p>To save the current form as an image, choose <i>Save as image</i> in the <i>File</i> menu. You will then get the option, depending on your browser, to save the image or view it immediately.</p>
<h2>Saving or printing all forms</h2>
<p>To save or print all forms, choose <i>Print forms</i> in the <i>File</i> menu. If you want to print the rest is self explanatory. If you want to save the forms as a PDF file you can choose to 'print to PDF' on Mac OSX or Linux.
 On Windows it is possible to have the same option by installing software that does this, such as <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator target=_blank>PDFcreator</a>.</p>
