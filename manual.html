<h1>OpenAero manual - General</h1>
<p>OpenAero is sequence design software that runs inside your web browser. This makes it available on practically any computer, tablet and even smartphone. 
However, for the best experience the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome browser</a> is recommended.<br>
To have maximum space available for using the software it is advisable to use the full-screen mode of the browser by pressing F11 on your keyboard.<br>
The latest version of OpenAero can be used on <a href="http://openaero.net">openaero.net</a>. If you want to download the software for use when you are not online, please refer to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/open-aero/wiki/Installation" target="_blank">Installation</a>.</p>

<h1>Creating sequences</h1>
<p>Sequences can be created in two ways:
<ul>
<li>By writing them in code in the sequence line</li>
<li>By selecting and editing figures with the Figure editor</li>
</ul>
The desciptions below refer to using the figure editor. For the correct codes for using the sequence line, please refer to 
<a href=# onClick="window.open('language.html', 'OpenAero language', 'menubar=no, scrollbars=yes, status=no, toolbar=no, top=30px, width=900px');">OpenAero language</a>.
</p>

<h3>Beginning a sequence</h3>
Start by filling out the Sequence info. The <i>Rules</i>, <i>Category</i> and <i>Program</i> information will be used for determining sequence validity.<br>
In the <i>Sequence</i> menu you can choose to start the sequence downwind or crossbox. This can always be changed at a later stage.

<h3>Adding a figure</h3>
<p>Go to the <i>Figure editor</i> tab and click on the <i>Click to add figure</i> box. A figure chooser will now appear from which you can 
choose a group (e.g. 1.3 Three Lines) and a specific base figure.<br>
When you select a figure this will become active and shown in magenta in the sequence area. It will also be shown in the figure area where you can:
<ul>
<li>Switch X-axis or Y-axis exit direction (for some figures)</li>
<li>Delete the figure</li>
<li>Zoom the figure</li>
<li>Move the figure to a different position</li>
<li>Extend or shorten the entry and exit lines</li>
<li>Add/delete/change rolls</li>
<li>Extend or shorten lines before and after rolls</li>
</ul>
When you are done editing the figure you can click anywhere in the sequence area to deactivate the figure and add a new figure at the end.</p>

<h3>Selecting and moving a figure</h3>
<p>To select a figure, click on the start or select it in the sequence line. The figure is now magenta and can be edited with the figure editor.<br>
For repositioning, it can be dragged anywhere by holding down the mouse button after clicking the figure start.</p>

<h3>Keeping the figures separate</h3>
<p>When figures are overlapping they can be dragged to a new position. 
It is also possible to use <i>Separate figures</i> from the <i>Sequence</i> menu to separate all figures.</p>

	<h1>Opening, saving and printing sequences</h1>

<h3>Opening sequences</h3>
<p>To open an existing sequence, choose <i>Open sequence</i> in the <i>File</i> menu. You will be asked to choose a file. Sequence files always end in .seq and can be created either with OLAN or OpenAero.</p>

<h3>Saving sequences</h3>
<p>To save the current sequence as a .seq file, choose <i>Save sequence</i> in the <i>File</i> menu. Your computer will then download the data and, depending on the browser, ask for a file name to save the sequence as. Always ensure to give the sequence a file name ending in .seq!
 These files can only be opened by OpenAero and not by OLAN.</p>

<h3>Saving the current form (A, B or C) as an image</h3>
<p>To save the current form as an image, choose <i>Save as image</i> in the <i>File</i> menu. You will then get the option, depending on your browser, to save the image or view it immediately.</p>

<h3>Saving or printing all forms</h3>
<p>To save or print all forms, choose <i>Print forms</i> in the <i>File</i> menu. If you want to print the rest is self explanatory. If you want to save the forms as a PDF file you can choose to 'print to PDF' on Mac OSX or Linux.
 On Windows it is possible to have the same option by installing software that does this, such as <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator target=_blank>PDFcreator</a>.</p>
