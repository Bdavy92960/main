		<p>OpenAero is aerobatic sequence design software available from
		<a href="http://openaero.net/" target="_blank">OpenAero.net</a> that runs inside your 
		web browser. This makes it available on practically any computer, tablet 
		and even Smartphone. For the best experience the
		<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> 
		web browser is recommended, and currently
		<a href="http://www.ez-download.com/mozilla-firefox" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a> 
		also works well. Other web browsers may offer sufficient W3C standards 
		compatibility to function correctly, but not all. It is useful to set 
		the full-screen browser mode (usually by pressing F11 on your keyboard) 
		to have the maximum screen space available when using OpenAero.</p>
		<p>The latest version of the software is always presented when you are 
		online, and will be installed automatically. Once you have visted
		<a href="http://openaero.net/" target="_blank">openaero.net</a> your current version of 
		the software will also be available to you when you are offline. For 
		tablets and Smartphones it will help to click <i>View ... Mobile version</i> 
		and the layout will be adjusted to fit the narrower screen format.</p>
		<p>Even though no other software besides OpenAero is necessary to 
		produce complete and valid aerobatic sequences, the ready availability 
		of an official and current copy of the relevant power or glider
		<a href="http://www.arestisystem.com/" target="_blank">Aresti catalog</a> is recommended 
		for checking.</p>
    <p>This manual is intended for users of OpenAero. If you are interested in 
    development of additions to OpenAero, including (National) rules, please

		<p>Aerobatic sequences can be created within OpenAero in either of two 
		ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>By selecting and editing figures with the <i>Figure Editor</i></li>
			<li>By writing the figures in code in the text line above the 
			sequence</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The descriptions here refer to using the 
		<i>Figure Editor</i>. For the 
		correct codes when using the text line above the sequence area please 
		refer to <a href="language.html" target="_blank">OpenAero language <i>Help</i></a>.</p>

		<img border="0" src="images/OA_FigureAddPanel.gif" width="174" height="129" align="left">Go 
		to the <i>Figure editor</i> tab and click on the <i>Click to add figure</i> box. A 
		figure chooser will appear from which you can choose a group (for 
		example 1.2 Two Lines) and then a specific base figure. At any point in a 
		figure where the attitude must change from erect 
		to inverted (or the reverse) a half-roll is 
		shown and will be 
		incorporated when the figure is inserted; 
		this 
		is easily changed for an alternate roll using the controls. If there are existing figures 
		select the option 
		to tell OpenAero where the new figure should be placed. Figures that are eligible 
		to be placed in the current position (i.e. with the correct entry and/or exit 
		attitude) are marked by a green line around the top and left sides of 
		their images.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		When a figure is added or selected it becomes active and is drawn in 
		magenta in the sequence area. The Form-B table is always updated to display 
		all the Aresti element codes and K-factors. Base figures and elements that are 
		not &#39;legal&#39; according to the rules in effect are shown in that table 
		with zero K.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		The current figure is also shown in the figure editing area where you can:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Switch 
			X-axis or Y-axis exit direction (for some figures)</li>
			<li>Delete the figure</li>
			<li>Change the Y-axis direction</li>
			<li>Zoom the figure larger or smaller</li>
			<li>Move the figure to a different position - with no line, or with 
			a straight or curved dotted connecting line</li>
			<li>
			Add / delete / change rolls, 
			and flip their left / right orientation to avoid location over other 
			elements</li>
			<li>Extend or shorten the entry and exit lines, or the lengths before and after 
			the rolls</li>
			<li>Click the figure-start and -end symbols to reverse the current 
			erect / inverted setting</li>
			<li>Set the figure as the start of a new sub-sequence for easier 
			sequence composition</li>
			<li>For Free Unknown sequences designate the figure with letters A 
			to J, or as a connecting figure</li>
      <li>Add / delete / change figure comments</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When you have finished editing the figure click in an adjacent space 
		to deactivate it, then you can add a new figure at the end of the 
		sequence or optionally at the beginning. If a figure is highlighted when 
		you click to add a figure then it will be opened again for editing.</p>

          <li>Free sequences: OpenAero will resolve an excess sequence K

      <p><strong>Power and Glider Advanced and Unlimited</strong>

          figure with the officially designated alpha character (power 
          'A' to 'J', glider 'A' to G'). Linking figures should be 
          identified as 'Free Unknown Link', and OpenAero will reset 
          them to 24K total (power) or 10K total (glider).</li>

    <p><i>TIP</i> : A poorly laid-out sequence that is difficult to 
    follow can be a real problem for judges - time spent creating an

		<p>To save the current sequence as a <i>&quot;filename.seq&quot;</i> file, choose 
		<i>Save 
		sequence</i> in the <i>File menu</i>. Your computer will bounce the data through 
		the OpenAero server and, depending on how you have set your browser, ask 
		for a file name to save the sequence; in Chrome be sure to tick <i>&quot;Ask 
		where to save each file before downloading&quot;</i> on the <i>Advanced Settings</i> 
		page. Always be sure to give the sequence a file name ending in <i>&quot;.seq&quot; 
		- </i>these files can subsequently be opened only by OpenAero and not by OLAN.</p>
		<p>To create a link that holds your complete sequence, choose <i>Save as 
		link</i> in the <i>File menu</i>. It is useful to right-click here and choose 
		<i>&quot;Copy

		<p><u><i><b><font size="4">Saving the current form (A, B or C) as an 
		image</font></b></i></u></p>
		<p>To save the current form as an image, choose <i>Save as image</i> in the  
		<i>File</i> menu. You will then get the option, depending on your browser, to 
		save the image as a Scalable Graphics Image or view it immediately. 
		These images can be opened in most browsers and many other applications 
		- see <a href="http://www.fileinfo.com" target="_blank">www.fileinfo.com</a> for further 
		advice.</p>
		<p><u><i><b><font size="4">Saving a sequence's figures as separate

		<p>To save the current sequence figures as separate images, choose <i>Save figs separate</i> in the

		contains every figure of your sequence as a separate SVG image.<br />
		The images are oriented according the sequence flow and the form 
		currently being viewed (B or C).</p>
		<p><u><i><b><font size="4">Printing sequences<br>
		</font></b></i></u>To print some or all of the sequence forms, choose <i>Print forms</i> in the 
		<i>File menu</i>, and select the appropriate options. To save the forms as a 
		PDF file in Windows you will need some software that does this for you,

    <a href="http://www.exp-systems.com/pdfredirect/downloads.htm" target="_blank">PDF reDirect v2</a>.

        It may be useful to add the submitting Team name or ISO country code

        identification letter &quot;@A&quot;, &quot;@B&quot; etc. and before the figure code - 
        for example &quot;@F USA&quot;. This will be shown in the grid 
        adjacent to the figure designation if present, 
        or the first Aresti manoeuvre code if not.<br>
