		<p>OpenAero is aerobatic sequence design software available from
		<a href="http://openaero.net/" target="_blank">OpenAero.net</a> that
    runs inside your web browser. This makes it available on practically
    any computer, tablet and even Smartphone. For the best experience the
		<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> 
		web browser is recommended, and currently
		<a href="http://www.ez-download.com/mozilla-firefox" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a> 
		also works well. Other web browsers may offer sufficient W3C standards 
		compatibility to function correctly, but not all. It is useful to set 
		the full-screen browser mode (usually by pressing F11 on your keyboard) 
		to have the maximum screen space available when using OpenAero.</p>
		<p>The latest version of the software is always presented when you are 
		online, and will be installed automatically. Once you have visted
		<a href="http://openaero.net/" target="_blank">openaero.net</a> your
    current version of the software will also be available to you when
    you are offline. For small tablets and Smartphones it will help to
    click <i>View ... Mobile version</i> and the layout will be adjusted
    to fit the narrower screen format.</p>
    <p>As of OpenAero 1.4.0 a Chrome App for desktop is also available.
    This provides:
    <ul>
      <li>Improved file saving</li>
      <li>Adding OpenAero to your desktop to start without opening
      Chrome browser</li>
    </ul>
    It can be installed through the <i>Tools</i> menu at any time. After
    installing it can be launched from a blank Chrome tab. By right-clicking
    there you will have the option to add a link to your Desktop and/or
    Start Menu. 
    </p>
		<p>Even though no other software besides OpenAero is necessary to 
		produce complete and valid aerobatic sequences, the ready availability 
		of an official and current copy of the relevant power or glider
		<a href="http://www.arestisystem.com/" target="_blank">Aresti catalog</a> is recommended 
		for checking.</p>
    <p>This manual is intended for users of OpenAero. If you are interested in 
    development of additions to OpenAero, including (National) rules, please

			<li>By selecting and editing figures with the <i>Figure Editor</i></li>
			<li>By writing the figures in code in the text line above the 
			sequence</li>

		<img border="0" src="images/OA_FigureAddPanel.gif" width="174" height="129" align="left">Go 
		to the <i>Figure editor</i> tab and click on the <i>Click to add figure</i> box. A 
		figure chooser will appear from which you can choose a group (for 
		example 1.2 Two Lines) and then a specific base figure. At any point in a 
		figure where the attitude must change from erect 
		to inverted (or the reverse) a half-roll is 
		shown and will be 
		incorporated when the figure is inserted; 
		this 
		is easily changed for an alternate roll using the controls. If there are existing figures 
		select the option 
		to tell OpenAero where the new figure should be placed. Figures that are eligible 
		to be placed in the current position (i.e. with the correct entry and/or exit 
		attitude) are marked by a green line around the top and left sides of 
		their images.</p>
    <p>When there are Sequence rules active that prohibit the use of
    certain base figures, those figures will not be shown. It is
    possible to show these figures (with a red border) by unselecting
    <i>Hide illegal figs</i>.</p>
		<p>
		When a figure is added or selected it becomes active and is drawn in 
		magenta in the sequence area. The Form-B table is always updated to display 
		all the Aresti element codes and K-factors. Base figures and elements that are 
		not &#39;legal&#39; according to the rules in effect are shown in that table 
		with zero K.</p>
		<p>The current figure is also shown in the figure editing area where you can:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Switch 
			X-axis or Y-axis exit direction (for some figures)</li>
			<li>Delete the figure</li>
			<li>Change the Y-axis direction</li>
			<li>Zoom the figure larger or smaller</li>
			<li>Move the figure to a different position - with no line, or with 
			a straight or curved dotted connecting line</li>
			<li>Add / delete / change rolls, and:
        <ul>
          <li>Flip their left / right orientation to avoid location over
          other elements</li>
          <li>Flip the roll fraction number (e.g. 3/4)</li>
          <li>Add a comment (will be placed after fraction number where
          applicable)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
			<li>Extend or shorten the entry and exit lines, or the lengths
      before and after the rolls</li>
			<li>Click the figure-start and -end symbols to reverse the current 
			erect / inverted setting</li>
			<li>Set the figure as the start of a new sub-sequence for easier 
			sequence composition</li>
			<li>For Free Unknown sequences designate the figure with letters A 
			to J, or as a connecting figure</li>
      <li>Add / delete / change figure comments</li>
		</ul>
    <p><strong>Some of these options are not available for figures that
    have a Free Unknown letter to avoid changing Free Unknown figures.
    </strong></p>
		<p>When you have finished editing the figure click in an adjacent space 
		to deactivate it, then you can add a new figure at the end of the 
		sequence or optionally at the beginning. If a figure is highlighted when 
		you click to add a figure then it will be opened again for editing.</p>

      sequence figures</h3>
      <p>When on the Sequence Info panel a combination of Class : Rules : Category : Program 
      is set that requires special handling to meet CIVA regulations, 
      the software will provide the following automated handling:</p>
      <p><strong>Glider Advanced and Unlimited</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Free sequences: OpenAero will resolve an excess sequence K 
          total of up to 3 in accordance with 4.3.3.1.b). The original 
          figure-K is shown in brackets below the adjusted value.</li>

      </p>
      <p><strong>Power and Glider Advanced and Unlimited</strong>

      <h3>Selecting and moving a figure</h3>
      <p>To select a figure, click on it or select it in the sequence
      text line. The figure is now magenta and can be edited with the 
      figure editor. For repositioning it can be dragged anywhere by holding 
      down the mouse button after clicking the figure. Note: this can
      not be done for figure 1.</p>
      <p>After moving a figure it's possible to change the curved line 
      to a straight line by clicking the <i>Straight line</i> button in
      the Figure editor. It's also possible to remove the line, but for
      clarity only for horizontal moves. This can be done by clicking the
      <i>Move figure forward</i> button.</p>
      <p><i>TIP</i> : A poorly laid-out sequence that is difficult to 
      follow can be a real problem for judges - time spent creating an 
      easily understood flow of figures can be a good way to help improve 
      your marks. Make sure to use the straight and curved dotted lines to 
      show how your figures follow each other.</p>

		<h3>Using the OpenAero &#39;Queue&#39;</h3>
		<p>The queue system provides a way to copy selected figures to a

		insertion at other positions in the sequence. This enables the figures 
		in any sequence to be re-ordered to improve the sequence design, though 
		you must take care of erect or inverted entry conditions and continue / 
		reverse / change axis effects. The queue and its figures can also be 
		saved to disk for later re-use - when re-opened they are accessible 
		through the &quot;* Figure Queue&quot; item at the top of the figure / family 
		selection drop-list.</p>
    <p>The background of queue figures will be grey when the figure is
    already present in the sequence.</p>
    <p>All figures in a sequence can be added to the queue at once by 
    clicking <i>Add all to queue</i>. All figures can be removed from
    the queue with <i>Clear queue</i>.</p>

      separate all figures from each other.</p>
       <p>OpenAero can also position new and updated figures clear
      of previous and subsequent figures automatically. To activate
      this, go to <i>General Settings</i> and select the option
      <i>Automatically position new/changed figures clear of others</i>.

		against the rules that you have selected in the <i>Sequence Info</i> setup. 
		Note that any construction errors are shown in the <i>Alerts</i> box below the 
		figure editor. If you print the sequence you can opt to add the <i>Sequence 
		Check Result</i> to the bottom of your Form B, C, R or L.</p>
		<p>Several sequences can be checked simultaneously by choosing and/or dragging 
		their files to the box shown when you click menu item <i>Tools ... Check 
		multiple seq</i>.</p>
    <p>When creating a Free Unknown sequence, it is possible to use the
    original submitted figures to check if they are correct in your
    sequence. To do this, click <i>Reference sequence</i> in the
    <i>Sequence info</i> tab. A dialog will show where you can enter
    a sequence string for a reference sequence. This string can for
    example be copied from the main sequence text area when you have
    the original submitted figures opened in OpenAero.</p>
    <h3>Floating Point correction</h3>
    <p>In some sequence types, a Floating Point correction is
    allowed. This means that one or more K points may be deducted from
    the figures with the highest K factors if this is necessary to
    reduce total sequence K to the maximum allowed.</p>
    <p>The Floating Point correction is automatically applied when
    corresponding rules are set in the Sequence Info.</p>

      <h2>Creating a Known Free sequence</h2>
      As of 2016, CIVA has replaced the Known and Free sequences with
      the Known Free. The following method is recommended for creating
      Known Free sequences with OpenAero:
      <ul>
        <li>Open the correct sequence figures from the Demo menu. The
        figures will be shown in a grid layout</li>
        <li>Choose "Add all to queue" from the "Queue" menu to put these
        figures in the Queue</li>
        <li>Switch to "Form B" from the "View" menu and start designing
        your sequence. The required figures are available at all times
        from the Queue</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3" id="free_unknown_designer">
      <h2>The Free Unknown designer</h2>
      This is the most efficient way to design a Free Unknown sequence
      from a list of submitted Unknown figures. It can be found under
      the <i>Tools</i> menu. Because of required screen size it is not
      available in the mobile layout.
      <h3>Getting started</h3>
      Open a sequence file containing the Free Unknown figures from the
      <i>File</i> menu, or by clicking a link holding the sequence that
      has been provided to you. If the sequence is correctly formatted
      (correct rules, all figure letters assigned, no other figures)
      OpenAero should automatically start the Free Unknown designer.<br />
      Otherwise, you can start it from the <i>Tools</i> menu.<br />
      If OpenAero detects it is just a figures file you will start with
      an empty sequence. Otherwise, the current sequence will be shown.
      <p><image src="images/OA_FreeUnknownDesignerMain.png" align="right"></image>
      <h3>Sequence layout</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the designer is to quickly create a sequence. For
      this reason, layout is schematic and fully automated. There are no
      options for changing this.<br />
      Multiple subsequences can be used, joined and copied in the design
      environment.<br />
      In the sequences, submitted figures are marked with a green border
      and linking figures with a blue border.</p>
      <p>When the sequence is complete, click the <i>Finalize sequence
      &amp; exit Free Unknown Designer</i> button to change the layout
      of the sequence.</p>
      <h3>Adding and changing figures in a subsequence</h3>
      <p>All submitted Free Unknown figures are visible on the lefthand
      <i>Figures</i> tab. They can be dragged and dropped into a
      subsequence and will be placed before the figure over which they
      are dropped. To create a new subsequence, drag the figure to
      <i>New / copy subsequence</i>.<br />
      Figures that are used exactly once in any of the subsequences are
      marked by a green border. Figures that are used multiple times (or
      more than the maximum amount of links for the LINK figure) are
      marked orange.</p>
      <p>To remove a figure, click the cross in the righthand upper
      corner.</p>
      <p>Linking figures can be added by dropping the 'LINK' block. After
      this has been done the linking figure can be changed after
      selecting it by clicking.<br />
      The submitted figures also have some options that can be changed
      when selected.<br />
      </p>
      <h3>Manipulating subsequences</h3>
      The entry direction of each subsequence can be chosen by selecting
      the first figure of it and setting <i>Sub sequence entry
      direction</i>.<br />
      Subsequences can be dragged as a whole into another subsequence.
      The whole subsequence will then be inserted before the figure over
      which it is dragged. Dragging a subsequence to <i>New /copy
      subsequence</i> will create a copy of the subsequence.
      <h3>Finalizing the sequence</h3>
      When the sequence is complete, with all submitted figures and
      required links, it can be finalized by clicking <i>Finalize
      sequence & exit Free Unknown Designer</i>. Any errors will be
      reported. You will then be returned to the regular sequence editor
      where you can adjust layout.

      <h3>Opening, Saving and Printing sequences</h3>
      <h4>Opening sequences</h4>
      <p>To open an existing sequence, choose <i>Open sequence</i> in the <i>File menu</i> 
      and navigate to locate and open the required sequence file. Sequence 
      files always end in &quot;.seq&quot; and may have been created either with 
      OpenAero or originally in OLAN.<br />
      It is also possible to open a sequence from a PNG image file created
      with OpenAero 1.5.0.4 or later. <!--This is the <strong>only</strong>
      way to open sequences on iOS.-->
      </p>
      <h4>Saving sequences</h4>
      <p>To save the current sequence as a <i>&quot;filename.seq&quot;</i>
      file, choose <i>Save sequence</i> in the <i>File menu</i>. Depending
      on how you have set your browser, your computer will ask 
      for a file name to save the sequence; in Chrome be sure to use the
      '≡' Customize and control button in the header area, then click
      the Settings item so that you can tick "Ask where to save each
      file before downloading" on the Advanced Settings page. Always be
      sure to give the sequence a file name ending in <i>&quot;.seq&quot; 
      - </i>these files can subsequently be opened only by OpenAero and not by OLAN.</p>
      <p>To create a link that holds your complete sequence, choose <i>Save as 
      link</i> in the <i>File menu</i>. It is useful to right-click here and choose 
      <i>&quot;Copy Link Address&quot;</i> to transfer this link to your computer&#39;s clipboard.</p>
      <h4 id="save_print"  >Saving or Printing sequences</h4>
      <p>To save or print some or all of the sequence forms, choose
      <i>Print/save forms</i> in the <i>File menu</i>, and select the
      appropriate options. To save the forms as a PDF file in Windows you
      will need some software that does this for you, such as
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator" target="_blank">PDFcreator</a> or 
      <a href="http://www.exp-systems.com/pdfredirect/downloads.htm" target="_blank">PDF reDirect v2</a>. 
      In a Mac OSX or Linux machine you can simply choose to &#39;print to PDF&#39;.</p>
      <p>You can also save one or multiple forms as as image. Two formats
      are available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>PNG</strong> : For saving images that can be viewed by
          any computer, tablet or smartphone. Make sure to save these images
          in a large enough resolution (set at <i>Saving PNG or SVG image</i>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SVG</strong> : For images that will always stay sharp,
          even when viewed with large magnification. These images can be
          opened in most browsers and many other applications - see
          <a href="http://www.fileinfo.com" target="_blank">www.fileinfo.com</a>
          for further advice.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>iPad/iPhone: Only <strong>Save PNG image</strong> is available.
      In Safari, you can then tap the <span class="iOSsaveIcon"></span>
      button to save or print the image.</p>
      <h4>Printing multiple sequences</h4>
      Multiple sequences can be printed without opening each sequence
      separately. This option can be found in the <i>Tools</i> menu.<br />
      This is especially usefull for contest organisers.
      <h4>Saving a sequence's figures as separate	images</h4>
      <p>To save the current sequence figures as separate images, choose
      <i>Save figs separate</i> in the <i>File</i> menu. You will then get
      the option to save a ZIP file that 
      contains every figure of your sequence as a separate image.<br />
      In the <i>Settings</i> menu, you can change the image format (png or
      svg) and the image size.<br />
      The images are oriented according the sequence flow and the form 
      currently being viewed (B or C).</p>

        Either from the very start or from an existing sequence, <i>View ... 
        Figs in Grid</i> will set each figure into a tabular grid format showing the 
        K-factors and any other relevant information. Use <i>Tools ... Settings</i> to 
        change the number of grid columns if required. This grid can be printed 
        for distribution to sequence designers bearing all the relevant figure 
        information, so that submitted sequences conform to CIVA regulations.
      </p>

        It may be useful to add the submitting Team name or IOC country code 
        to the figure comments. This can also be done by typing it 
        between inverted marks into the sequence string after any Free Unknown 
        identification letter &quot;@A&quot;, &quot;@B&quot; etc. and before the figure code - 
        for example &quot;@F USA&quot;. This will be shown in the grid 
        adjacent to the figure designation if present, 
        or the first Aresti manoeuvre code if not.<br>
        Also, the country flag will be added to the Grid view 
        (courtesy of <a href="http://www.icondrawer.com" target="_blank">www.icondrawer.com</a>).

      <h3>Importing OpenAero files into ACRO</h3>
      <p>
        OpenAero files that are stored in <i>&quot;filename.seq&quot;</i> format can be 
        directly imported into the ACRO scoring software, thus providing a swift 
        and accurate method for transferring all of the required figure 
        information. Note that the OpenAero figure text string does not 
        provide the necessary data for this procedure, and should generally be 
        avoided if possible.

      <p>The <i>Settings</i> dialog offers options for changing the look

          <li>Choose if new or changed figures should be positioned
          clear of previous and subsequent figures automatically. This
          will only be done when the figure is completely new or not
          similar to a replaced figure and only when selected from the
          figure chooser</li>

          saving all figures as separate images in a ZIP file</li>
          <li>Change the filename pattern for saving all figures as
          separate images in a ZIP file. The following replacement

          <ul>
            <li><strong>pos</strong> : positive line</li>
            <li><strong>neg</strong> : negative line</li>
            <li><strong>rollText</strong> : roll font (e.g. 2x8, 3/4 etc)</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Set realistic-looking perspective for turns</li>
          <li>Restore all settings to their default values</li>

      on another system it will look different from your version if you
      change some of the styling values!</p>
