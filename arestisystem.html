<h2>The Aresti aerocryptographic system</h2>
<p>In order to write aerobatic manoeuvres, figures and sequences down on paper so that other people can read, fly and judge them a universal 'language' is essential. The system used throughout the aerobatic world was originally developed by the Spanish aerobatic pilot Jos&eacute; Louis Aresti Aguirre. Many others have since contributed improvements to keep the system up to date.</p>
<p>All these figures are compiled in the Aresti Catalogue, which can be ordered from <a href=http://www.arestisystem.com/ target=_blank>www.arestisystem.com</a>.
<p>Below there are some extracts from different texts by mr Jos&eacute; Louis Aresti Aguirre:</p><i>
<p>...How to get an unity of criterion and harmony among all aviators of the world (where hundred of languages and thousends of dialects are spoken) so in a practicle and simple way can express and understand themselves in a single aeronautic language?....<br /><br />....How to manage to make it easy to understand, feasible in written and oral practice, and understandable, in and for, such a diverse world?.... <br /><br />....How to help as much as posible, if we wish among all, the development and progress of Artistic Fligth and Aeronautics in general?.... <br /><br />....Whith the purpose of giving answer to all these questions the Aerocriptographic Aresti System was born (Aerocriptographic is a greek word with three concentrated meanings, the aireal, the hidden and the written ones. Its pronuntation, definition and written are equal or very similar in many languages), an idiom useful, simple, practicle and over all UNIVERSAL! The alphabet of the Aerocriptographic System are its basic keys , and the idiom is the development of the alphabet..... <br /><br />....This system consist on putting at disposition of any pilot thousands and thousands of combinations of artistic figures with their difficulty coefficients, duly methodized, divided in groups or homogeneous families related between then, as it never has been done until now, as it was never possible to define in every language of the world not even thousands of figures but only hundred of them for lack of expression and systematization.... <br /><br />....As the aeronautical technical development of pilots and airplanes is continuous, this list of figures has been design so it does not remaing static in case is necesary to renovate figures or complete families and their corresponding coefficients. All work that reaches esteem and aspires to be conserved will need corrections and contributions in a constant effort of renovation.... <br /><br />....Today, this aerocryptographic work may seem simple and easy to understand, but it is the result of many years of aeronautical experiance and of tiring, detailed work alone, without the slightest compensation wich could cover the enormous expenses incurred over the years. For example, today, the Method of Evaluation or the basic key of the optional rol may appear simple, but at the time I had to create them, in order to go on to develop the system with efficiency. This evaluation method is so simple and practical that one or all of the basic values assigned to the ten straight flights and the two looping circles can be varied if the technical advances of aviation so require. Such a variation will no imply any change to this old but efficient Method of Evaluation of aerobatic figures.... <br /><br />.... The only moral compensation to this inmense work and squander of illusion, genius and effort, is to have the enormous satisfaction as an individual and an aviator, of having contributed and continuing to contribute to the ability of pilots to understand each other in a single worldwide aerocryptographical language.... <br /><br />....The idea of being useful to pilots of any part of the world, with the sincere intention of cooperating in the spreading of the most espectacular branch of aviation now existing: The High Class Artistic Flight..... <br /><br />....If with this work undertaken years ago I can make posible the understanding of a group of people that speak different languages, I will feel as well used many hours of occupation in this laborious and alternating task between the earth and the air; between the air and the earth....</i>
